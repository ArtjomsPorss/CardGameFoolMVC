created with help of ideas and card images from https://github.com/FBergeron/javasol

Research on Model-View-Controller(MVC) software development methodology that's to be implemented in GUI-based version of previously created Card Game project

It is waiting for me to finish Oracle Java Associate exam on 21st of Sept and then I will concentrate on developing the game as well as porting it to Android.
If you want to hack with it, this is an Eclipse project.
If you work in other IDE, download files and add java files to your own project. Just don't forget that card images are in GuiStudy/bin/images/card and they are necessary(hardcoded in Card.java file) for you to see cards in game ;))
